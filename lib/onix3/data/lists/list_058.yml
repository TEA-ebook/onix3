      basis are sold on firm-sale terms, where a particular product is tailored for
      a specific retail outlet (often termed a ‘premium’ product), or where other
      specific conditions or qualiifications apply. Further details of the modified
      terms and conditions should be given in <PriceTypeDescription>.

    :description: Freight-pass-through RRP excluding tax
    :notes: In the US, books are sometimes supplied on ‘freight-pass-through’ terms,
      where a price that is different from the RRP is used as the basis for calculating
      the supplier’s charge to a reseller. To make it clear when such terms are being
      invoked, code 31 is used instead of code 01 to indicate the RRP. Code 32 is
      used for the ‘billing price’.

    :description: Freight-pass-through billing price excluding tax
    :notes: When freight-pass-through terms apply, the price on which the supplier’s
      charge to a reseller is calculated, ie the price to which trade discount terms
      are applied. See also code 31.
