    :description: Update (partial)
    :notes: In ONIX 3.0 only, use when sending a ‘block update’ record. A block update
      implies using the supplied block(s) to update the existing record for the product,
      replacing only the blocks included in the block update, and leaving other blocks
      unchanged – for example, replacing old information from Blocks 4 and 6 with
      the newly-received data while retailing information from Blocks 1–3 and 5 untouched.
      In previous ONIX releases, and for ONIX 3.0 using other notification types,
      updating is by replacing the complete record with the newly-received data

    :description: Delete
    :notes: 'Use when sending an instruction to delete a record which was previously
      issued. Note that a Delete instruction should NOT be used when a product is
      cancelled, put out of print, or otherwise withdrawn from sale: this should be
      handled as a change of Publishing status, leaving the receiver to decide whether
      to retain or delete the record. A Delete instruction is used ONLY when there
      is a particular reason to withdraw a record completely, eg because it was issued
      in error'
