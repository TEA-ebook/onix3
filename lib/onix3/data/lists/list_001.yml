    :description: Delete
    :notes: 'Use when sending an instruction to delete a record which was previously
      issued. Note that a Delete instruction should NOT be used when a product is
      cancelled, put out of print, or otherwise withdrawn from sale: this should be
      handled as a change of Publishing status, leaving the receiver to decide whether
      to retain or delete the record. A Delete instruction is only used when there
      is a particular reason to withdraw a record completely, eg because it was issued
      in error.'
