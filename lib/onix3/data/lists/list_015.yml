    :notes: The full text of the distinctive title of the item, without abbreviation
      or abridgement. For books, where the title alone is not distinctive, elements
      may be taken from a set or series title and part number etc to create a distinctive
      title. Where the item is an omnibus edition containing two or more works by
      the same author, and there is no separate combined title, a distinctive title
      may be constructed by concatenating the individual titles, with suitable punctuation,
      as in “Pride and prejudice / Sense and sensibility / Northanger Abbey”.
