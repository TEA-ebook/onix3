      the date from which the embargo is lifted and retail sales and fulfillment of
      pre-orders are permitted. Use code 02 here ONLY in the exceptional case when
      the embargo is supplier-specific. More general market-wide or global sales embargos
      should be specified in <MarketDate> or <PublishingDate> codes. In the absence
      of any supplier-specific, market-wide or general embargo date, retail sales
      and pre-order fulfillment may begin as soon as stock is available to the retailer
