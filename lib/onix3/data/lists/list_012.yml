    :description: US textbook
    :notes: In the US and Canada, a book that is published primarily for use by students
      in school or college education as a basis for study. Textbooks published for
      the elementary and secondary school markets are generally purchased by school
      districts for the use of students. Textbooks published for the higher education
      market are generally adopted for use in particular classes by the instructors
      of those classes. Textbooks are usually not marketed to the general public,
      which distinguishes them from trade books. Note that trade books adopted for
      course use are not considered to be textbooks (though a specific education edition
      of a trade title may be).
