      or in product information supplied by the publisher. The books in the collection
      generally share a subject, narrative, design style or authorship. They may may

    :description: Collection éditoriale
    :notes: The collection is a bibliographic collection defined and identified by
      a publisher, either on the product itself or in product information supplied
      by the publisher, where the books in the collection have no specific order,
      shared subject, narrative, style or shared authorship, and are grouped by the
      publisher largely for marketing purposes. The collection has many of the characteristics
      of an imprint or marque. Used primarily in French book publishing, to distinguish
      between ‘série’ (using the normal code 10) and ‘collection’ (code 11), and where
      the collection éditoriale is not an imprint

    :description: Ascribed collection
