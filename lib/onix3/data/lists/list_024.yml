    :description: Tracks
    :notes: Of an audiobook on CD (or a similarly divided selection of audio files).
      Conventionally, each track is 3â€“6 minutes of running time, and track counts
      are misleading and inappropriate if the average track duration is significantly
      more or less than this. Note that track breaks are not necessarily aligned with
      structural breaks in the text (eg chapter breaks).
