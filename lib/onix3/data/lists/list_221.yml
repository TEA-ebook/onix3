    :description: Message received
    :notes: Message received but not yet parsed (Acknowledgement must contain neither
      <MessageStatusDetail> nor <RecordStatusSummary>, and should include <NoProduct/>).
      There is no particular implication that the acknowledgement message is valid
      â€“ the status is based solely on receipt of a file and minimal parsing of the
      original ONIX message header to ascertain <MessageNumber> etc.. The Acknowledgement
      message MAY give a date when parsing is planned
