    :description: No reading system accessibility options disabled (except)
    :notes: No accessibility features offered by the reading system, device or reading
      software (including but not limited to choice of text size or typeface, choice
      of text or background color, text-to-speech) are disabled, overridden or otherwise
      unusable with the product EXCEPT – in ONIX 3 messages only – those specifically
      noted as subject to restriction or prohibition in <EpubUsageConstraint>. Note
      that provision of any significant part of the textual content as images (ie
      as pictures of text, rather than as text) inevitably prevents use of these accessibility
      options.

      of text organization above individual paragraphs (eg to all sections and subsections)
      and to all tables, figures, illustrations etc. Non-textual items such as illustrations,
      tables, audio or video content may be directly accessible from the Table of
      contents, or from a similar List of illustrations, List of tables, etc.

    :description: Reading order
    :notes: All or substantially all textual matter is arranged in a single logical
      reading order (including text that is visually presented as separate from the
      main text flow, eg in boxouts, captions, tables, footnotes, endnotes, citations,
      etc). Non-textual content is also linked from within this logical reading order.
      (Purely decorative non-text content can be ignored.)

    :description: Short alternative descriptions
    :notes: All or substantially all non-text content has short alternative descriptions,
      usually provided via alt attributes. Note this applies to normal images (eg
      photographs, charts and diagrams) and also to any embedded audio, video etc.
      Audio and video content should include alternative descriptions suitable for
      hearing-impaired as well as for visually-impaired readers. (Purely decorative
      non-text content can be ignored, but the accessibility of resources delivered
      via a network connection rather than as part of the e-publication package must
      be included.)

      full alternative descriptions (eg audio-described video) and subtitles or closed
      captions suitable for hearing-impaired as well as for visually-impaired readers.
      (Purely decorative non-text content can be ignored, but the accessibility of
      resources delivered via a network connection rather than as part of the e-publication
      package must be included.)
